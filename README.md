## Description

Used comments to describe what different pieces of code form the textbook did, and also created programs allowing us to use turtle to let users build polygons and stars.

## What I Learned from This

I learned how to use loops more effectively by allowing them to do a lot of smaller functions within larger functions, I also learned more about booleans.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
